read me
create script/description
create ebs wait method
cron setup
initial wordpress username/email
report ebs health
when terminal master branch, make sure alt env is also terminated
put php config in app.json

// Get all instances
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value]'
